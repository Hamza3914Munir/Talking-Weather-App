My latest project: Talking Weather App! 🌦️

This app is designed to make weather updates accessible, interactive, and inclusive with several key features:

Location-Based Weather Updates 📍: The app requests user permission to access their current location and provides real-time weather data, including temperature, air speed, humidity, and a brief description.

City Search Functionality 🌐: Users can search for weather information in any city worldwide, making it easy to stay updated wherever they are or plan to go.

Text-to-Speech in Over 100 Languages 🌎🗣️: The app speaks weather information aloud in over 100 languages. Users can select their preferred language from a dropdown menu, making the app globally accessible and user-friendly.

Responsive Design 📱💻: The UI dynamically adjusts to fit any screen size, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

💼 This project combines state management, API integration, and localization to enhance user experience. I developed it using Flutter with Provider for state management. I look forward to sharing more projects like this that merge functionality and accessibility!
